As a Cloud Engineer, I specialize in designing, automating, and deploying scalable cloud infrastructure. My work focuses on delivering secure, production-ready environments using modern DevOps practices and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Here are some highlights of my accomplishments:
•	🚀 Built Scalable Infrastructure using Terraform and AWS CDK and Google cloud (GCP) for production-grade deployments on AWS (EKS, RDS, ALB, EC2 ASG, S3, CloudFront, Route 53, and more). GCP ( Compute engine, Firewall, VPC, cloud storage, Compute Storage, Cloud spanner, Cloud run, GKE and more)
	•	🔁 Implemented CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions for automated testing, deployment, and environment teardown.
	•	🔐 Designed secure VPC architectures with public/private subnets, NAT Gateways, IAM roles/policies, and multi-AZ high availability.
	•	📊 Integrated monitoring and observability stacks (Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch) for health checks, metrics, and alerting.
	•	🌐 Deployed containerized applications using Kubernetes (EKS), including Helm charts, Ingress controllers, and HPA configurations.
	•	🛠️ Built serverless workflows with AWS Lambda, S3, API Gateway, Step Functions, DynamoDB, and SQS for event-driven architectures.
	•	🔁 Delivered multi-region disaster recovery and cross-region replication strategies for business continuity.
	•	☁️ Automated image builds, ECS/EKS deploys, and S3-hosted static websites using IaC pipelines.
